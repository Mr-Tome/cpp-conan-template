# CPP Differential Equations

This is a cpp environment to learn and explore Differential Equation algorithms and implementations

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and configuring the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Git installed on your system.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine.
In your Git Bash window, change into the project directory.
Configure the project by running this command:

	./configure
	
- This script checks for dependencies and sets up the necessary configuration files for compiling and installing the software.

### Running Tests

TODO: Explain how to run tests for this system.

## Cleaning Up

If you wish to clean all items configured by the ./configure script, you can perform a clean operation. This is useful for resetting the machines state to its initial state:

	./configure clean

This command will remove any files or configurations that were set up during the `./configure` process, allowing you to start fresh.
