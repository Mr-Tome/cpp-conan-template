# Instructions for End Users
# 1. Configuration File Format:
#    * The configuration file is in INI format
#    * Sections are denoted by square brackets: [SectionName]
#    * Key-value pairs are separated by an equals sign: Key = Value
#    * Comments start with a # symbol
# 2. Modifying the Configuration:
#    a. Open the configuration file (e.g., specific_algorithm_config.ini) in a text editor
#    b. Locate the section and key you want to modify
#    c. Change the value after the equals sign
#    d. Save the file
# 3. Example Configuration:
#    [Section1]
#    name1 = 0
#    name2 = 1.0
#    [Section2]
#    name3 = 500.0
#    [Section3]
#    name4 = 10.0
#    name5 = 20.0
#    name1 = 30.0
#    name2 = 1.0,2.0,3.0
# 4. Adding New Values:
#    * You can add new key-value pairs to existing sections
#    * Do not add new sections unless instructed by the developers
# 5. Value Types:
#    * Numbers can be integers or decimals (e.g., 500 or 500.0)
#    * Text should not be enclosed in quotes
#    * Lists are comma-separated (e.g., 1.0,2.0,3.0)
# 6. Validation:
#    * Some values may have validation rules (e.g., must be positive)
#    * If you enter an invalid value, the application will use the default value
# 7. Troubleshooting:
#    * If the application fails to start, check for typos in the configuration file
#    * Ensure all required keys are present
#    * If in doubt, rename or delete the configuration file to reset to defaults
# 8. Best Practices:
#    * Keep a backup of the original configuration file
#    * Document any changes you make for future reference
#    * If you're unsure about a setting, consult the application documentation or contact the developers
# Remember, incorrect configuration can affect the application's performance or cause errors.
# If you're unsure about a setting, it's best to consult with the development team or refer to the application's documentation.
